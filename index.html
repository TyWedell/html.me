                     <p>
                          Anything can be turned into a medium for art. Before we were mass producing 4b penciles and inventing new colors of new types of paint;
                          people were painting with charcoal in caves. People love expression and their limitations shape their art. Given nothing but the Earth people
                          mixed dirt or charcoal with spit or animal fat and found a way to paint.

                     <h3>OOoohhh Shiney!</h3>
                     <p>
                         The Classical Period loved it's shiney rocks. Most of the art from this period was made of gold, bronze, silver, marble, or terracotta. 
                         Once you got people like the Ancient Greeks and they start taking things moving em around and building stuff we got people. Well we already had people, but they made statues of people.
                            They weren't gonna be happy with some abstract if you squint while standing on your head either. They wanted realism! And they did a pretty good job at it. I mean look at these statues.

                     <p>
                            Nope not doing it don't google greek statues... Somehow the ones without clothes survived more then the rest. Huh counter intuitive, moving on.

                     <h4>The Vast Open Sea</h4>
                     <p>
                         1600s the time of Explores. People like Magellan travelling the world naming oceans. Seriously who does that, he named the Pacific Ocean 'Mar Pacifico' or 'peacfull sea' in Portugese. wait a second.. 
                     </p>

                         Huh pacific actually means 'peaceful in character', and the Pacific Ocean ranks 3 for calmest oceans. +1 to Magellan. Wait what were we doing oh yea art.
                         Well in the time of these Great Namers people were running across all these never before seen animals, well is anything really unseen I mean ok if its born wouldn't it's parents see it or if it 
                         eats other animals they probably see it at some point. Not early enough obviously but some point. Right. Whatever they were coming across all these never before seen <b>by them</b> animals.
                         Like Elephants, who have these cool white peices of jewely coming out of their mouths. Well that's what our Great Namers thought anyway cause they killed them and necklaces. Not quite the mouth, that 
                         wouldn't come till the 1700s, but close enough. Now using there necklaces was not enough to fool the elephants into thinking our Great Namers were one of them. No they needed a way to know when the elphants 
                         were asleep so they used stuff like brass and steel to make clocks. Now if you don't think clocks are art look at this and then go argue with the swiss.
