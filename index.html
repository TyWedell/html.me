                            Anything can be turned into a medium for art. Before we were mass producing 4b penciles and
                            inventing new colors of new types of paint;
                            people were painting with charcoal in caves. People love expression and their limitations
                            shape
                            their art. Given nothing but the Earth people
                            mixed dirt or charcoal with spit or animal fat and found a way to paint.

                        <h3>OOoohhh Shiney!</h3>
                        <p>
                            The Classical Period loved it's shiney rocks. Most of the art from this period was made of
                            gold,
                            bronze, silver, marble, or terracotta.
                            Once you got people like the Ancient Greeks and they start taking things moving em around
                            and
                            building stuff we got people. Well we already had people, but they made statues of people.
                            They weren't gonna be happy with some abstract if you squint while standing on your head
                            either.
                            They wanted realism! And they did a pretty good job at it. I mean look at these statues.

                            1600s the time of Explores. People like Magellan travelling the world naming oceans.
                            Seriously
                            who
                            does that, he named the Pacific Ocean 'Mar Pacifico' or 'peacfull sea' in Portugese. wait a
                            second..

                            Huh pacific actually means 'peaceful in character', and the Pacific Ocean ranks 3 for
                            calmest
                            oceans. +1 to Magellan. Wait what were we doing oh yea art.
                            Well in the time of these Great Namers people were running across all these never before
                            seen
                            animals, well is anything really unseen I mean ok if its born wouldn't it's parents see it
                            or if
                            it
                            eats other animals they probably see it at some point. Not early enough obviously but some
                            point.
                            Right. Whatever they were coming across all these never before seen <b>by them</b> animals.
                            Like Elephants, who have these cool white peices of jewely coming out of their mouths. Well
                            that's
                            what our Great Namers thought anyway cause they killed them and necklaces. Not quite the
                            mouth,
                            that
                            wouldn't come till the 1700s, but close enough. Now using there necklaces was not enough to
                            fool
                            the
                            elephants into thinking our Great Namers were one of them. No they needed a way to know when
                            the
                            elphants
                            were asleep so they used stuff like brass and steel to make clocks. Now if you don't think
                            clocks
                            are art look at this and then go argue with the swiss.

                            Fast forward a few hundred years a bunch of important people, a lot of important things
                            happen
                            you
                            know
                            history stuff. Amongst all that stuff we got computers the most advanced calculating device
                            man
                            had
                            seen.
                            Of course there was someone tho that just thought "yea thats kinda boring, watch this." And
                            then
                            they
                            probably wrote some code. But then Art. Ok but the point of this tangent filled fever dream
                            through
                            history,
                            if there even was one, is that art can be made wtih anything. People are always finding new
                            forms of
                            expression
                            and coding hasn't escaped that path. There software called <a
